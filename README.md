# Module 21 Challenge - sms_spam_detector

## Description
This application helps users determine whether the text message they receive is classified as spam or not spam. They input the text message into the Gradio interface and it outputs the spam classification. The code located in gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb,  contains a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Then the Gradio app is set up to host the applicaiton.
